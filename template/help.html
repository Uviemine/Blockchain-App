	<h3>HOW THIS APP WORKS</h3>
<p>
	When you register, Bitcoin automatically generates 3 things for you:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>A PRIVATE KEY with which you can buy and send Bitcoin.</li>
	<li>A PUBLIC KEY which is generated from the private key.</li>
	<li>A BITCOIN ADDRESS which is generated from the public key.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	This can be verified by the following steps:
	<ul>
		<li>Visit blockchain.com.</li>
		<li>On the menu bar, click on Explorer.</li>
		<li>Copy your Bitcoin Address from this Web App and drop it in the Search box. Hit enter.</li>
		<li>Your Bitcoin account details will be displayed.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	You do not have to always visit the site in order to obtain your Bitcoin details. When you login, this App automatically displays your transactions, current balance in Bitcoin, USD and any other currency of your choice using real-time exchange rates.
